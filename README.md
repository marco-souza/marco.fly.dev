## Introduction

Welcome to my personal page!

This project showcases a comprehensive web application built using the latest
tools and technologies in the industry: GoFiber, HTMX, Tailwind, DaisyUI, and
more.

## Tech Stack

-   ðŸš€ HTMX: Powering our modern frontend

-   ðŸ“Š Golang: Powering our backend services

### HTMX

I've utilized HTMX to build a reusable and modular frontend that makes it easy
to create and maintain complex and highly-dynamic user interfaces. With HTMX, I
was able to streamline my development process and deliver a fast, responsive,
and highly interactive user experience.

### Go Templates

The project also leverages Go Templates to render dynamic HTML content. By using
templates, it can easily generate HTML content based on data from our backend
services, ensuring consistency across our application's UI.
